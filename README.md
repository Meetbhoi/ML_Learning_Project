# ML Learning Project

Implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch on the diabetes dataset.  
Part of my #LearnInPublic journey inspired by Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course.  

## 📌 Dataset
- PIMA Diabetes Dataset (binary classification: diabetic or not).

## ⚙️ Methods Implemented
- Feature Normalization
- Sigmoid Function
- Cost Function
- (Next step: Gradient Descent)

## 🚧 Work in Progress
Currently half-way done, will add gradient descent & comparison with scikit-learn soon.

## 📂 Repo Structure
- `logistic_regression.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with code  
- `notes.pdf` → My handwritten notes while learning  
- `plots/` → Visualizations  

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Finish gradient descent  
- Compare with scikit-learn results  
- Extend to other datasets
